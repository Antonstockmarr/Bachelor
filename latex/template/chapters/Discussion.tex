Now two different types of models have been developed - a linear regression model for describing the heat consumption as daily values and a time series model for the hourly consumption. \\

\noindent For the daily values both, a simple and a multiple regression model have been tested. The simple model only included the temperature as the independent variable. In relation to validation of the model, the diagnotic plots were not met at all. The model did not take several factors into account, which was seen in the residuals behaviour, thus the model was too simple. The multiple model started out as a full model that included all the relevant weather attributes. The purpose was to determine which factors should be included in a general multiple model for comparison of houses. The parameters that were significant for most of the houses were the temperature, solar radiation, the wind directions east and west. In the general regression model, all wind directions and their interaction with temperature were included. The behaviour of the residuals were definitely improved compared to the simple model and the model was concluded to be valid. By investigating the estimates of the temperature from the general model it was seen that the temperature were highly significant with negative sign for all houses and none of the 95\% confidence intervals were above zero. Furthermore, predictions for January 2019 using the model were used to support that the estimates indeed were good. The model was good at capturing the overall trend, and therefore the estimates could be concluded to be good enough to describe the influence of the temperature on the heat consumption. However, the predictions were made under the assumption that the weather forecasts were exact for the chosen period. This causes uncertainties for the predictions as they become better than actual data. Overall, the general regression model performs as it should, and it can be used to describe the daily heat consumption despite the uncertainties of using the model for predictions. \textcolor{red}{Mangler lidt.} \\

\noindent For the hourly values, different time series models was used on the data. First different models were tested and evaluated using the \texttt{arima} function. A single model was developed that could be applied to every house in the data set. The model was used to make predictions for unknown data, but it was not able to describe the consumption in a very satisfying way because random variations in the hour data were too dominating. A modification of the data was made to remove some of the variations from the data, but the model still did not perform well. Then a series of different models was developed using the \texttt{Marima} package in \texttt{R}. Different models were applied to a handful of houses. The models were used to compute the step response for each of the houses. But even for the best models modified with Fourier series, the estimates of the step response were much more uncertain than the temperature estimates found with the regression models. The validation of the regression model was much better than the validation of the time series model, so this is clearly the estimate that should be trusted.

\noindent As mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap: data} a function has been proposed that can reject houses from being modelled if they do not fulfill certain criteria. The function checks if there is a certain number of observations for each house. One can discuss whether the function could also be used after the model development. Based on the results given in Chapter \ref{chap: daily} there are several houses that could probably be omitted because they have too few observations or there are too many interpolations of missing observations in the house measurements. It can be problematic to predict a certian number of days ahead, e.g. 60 days, if there only exists observations for half a year. Furthermore, if there are too many missing values ​​that have been interpolated with the method mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap: data},then a data-checking function should discard the house, as it will have a negative impact on the further modelling of the heat consumption for that specific house. \\

\noindent The lack of information on e.g the number of residents in the house, the house's location, etc. affects the uncertainties of the models. The tap water consumption can depend on how many people live in the household, and there is therefore a high probability that the hot water consumption is higher than the heat consumption. This creates greater uncertainty as the models do not take the tap water consumption into account. The location of the house affects the estimates of the four different wind directions. If the location of each house was known, it would be easier to interpret the estimates. For example, if a terrace house is located between two other houses, it would make sense that the heat consumption would be less affected when the wind came from the directions where the house adjoins the other two houses. \\

\noindent Overall, there is a major problem with the way data is collected. It is clearly seen on an hourly basis, since data is measured per hour. By converting the measurements into daily values, the strange behavior of the measurements becomes less evident, which results in the regression models being used to describe the daily heat consumption. The biggest challenge then arises when the time series models are used to describe the hourly consumption.

\section{Future work}
Although the quality of data on an hourly basis has not been good enough to construct time series models, there is still something to work on in the project. At the same time, there is also a part that can be improved in relation to data and the way data is measured. \\

\noindent As mentioned, the models for the hourly values do not ​​work particularly well, so one of the things one could primarily work on, is to achieve more stable data. It does not make much sense to continue working on the models, as they cannot produce any useful results at this time. Another way of working on the time series models in the future, could be to investigate the winter period. The heat consumption is low during the summer, so it is the winter period that is of interest, and the models could possibly be improved by this action. \\

\noindent In proportion to data on a daily basis, an immediate idea would be to compare the wind dependency plots presented in \cref{fig: WKplot18} and \cref{fig: WKplot55} with the location of the houses and then use Google Earth to visualize the consumers house surrounded by a compas and the coloured shapes. Future work could also be a clustering that compares the houses' consumption with other houses in the same class. The clustering could be made based on the way the houses are heated, the houses' areas, year of construction etc.

\noindent The distribution of the tap water consumption is not quite clear, so if it could be identified when houses have some sort of "type" consumption such as wood stove, water pump, etc.,it would be possible to remove the tap water consumption from data. It would most likely result in an improvement in the performance of the models. Knowledge of the different heating patterns and methods in the houses, could then be used to classify the houses, and specific models could thus be developed for the different classes.

\noindent The method used for choosing the break point explained in Chapter \ref{chap: exploratory} could also be constructed in a more sofisticated way. And last but not least, the Data Checking function could be expanded such that it could determine how much data is needed for one house in order to make the models more robust. For example, one could also consider removing houses where the heat consumption is zero for an extended period, such as house 18.
